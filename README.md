Currently, updates can be found in the Snyk blog (https://snyk.io/blog/), Updates (https://updates.snyk.io/), and release notes (https://github.com/snyk/cli/releases). Users may also be receiving updates via Slack. To better manage the updates you receive and how you receive them, please download, fill out, and submit the Customer Preferred Communications document to your Snyk Account team.  \]
